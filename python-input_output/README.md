# **Python - Input/Output** :snake:

## **Description** :speech_balloon:

In Python, input/output (I/O) refers to the interaction between the program and the user or other external devices. It is the way you obtain data from the user, display information to the user, and perform operations with files and other external resources. There are many libraries and resources available to handle different types of I/O, such as networking, databases, serialization, and more.
