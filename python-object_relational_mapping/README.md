# **Python - Object-relational mapping** :computer:

## **Description:**:speech_balloon:

* Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a design pattern used in software development to facilitate the interaction between object-oriented systems and relational databases. ORM provides a layer of abstraction that allows developers to work with objects and object-oriented queries rather than writing raw SQL statements.

* With ORM, we can map your object-oriented model classes to database tables, and the ORM framework takes care of translating the operations performed on the objects into the appropriate SQL commands needed to interact with the database.

## **What we should learn from this project:**:bookmark_tabs:

* How to connect to a MySQL database from a Python script
* How to SELECT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
* How to INSERT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
* What ORM means
* How to map a Python Class to a MySQL table
