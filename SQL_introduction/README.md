# **SQL - Introduction** :computer:

## **Description** :speech_balloon:

* SQL, which stands for "Structured Query Language," is a powerful and widely-used programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. It serves as the standard language for communicating with relational database management systems (RDBMS) and provides a set of commands to interact with the data stored in the database.

* By utilizing SQL, users can efficiently store, organize, and retrieve data, making it a fundamental component for applications ranging from simple web applications to complex enterprise systems. Whether it's a small personal project or a large-scale business application, SQL empowers developers and data professionals to work with data in a structured and efficient manner.
