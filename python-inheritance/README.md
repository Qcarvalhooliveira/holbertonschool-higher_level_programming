# **Python - Inheritance** :snake:

## **Description** :speech_balloon:

 * Python inheritance is a powerful object-oriented programming feature that allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes. Inheritance promotes code reusability and enables the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.

## **What we should learn from this project:** :bookmark_tabs:

* What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass
* What is a subclass
* How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
* When can an instance have new attributes
* How to inherit class from another
* How to define a class with multiple base classes
* What is the default class every class inherit from
* How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
* Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
* What is the purpose of inheritance
* What are, when and how to use isinstance, issubclass, type and super built-in functions

# **Tasks** :books:

**0. Lookup**

Write a function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object

**1. My list**

Write a class MyList that inherits from list

**2. Exact same object**

Write a function that returns True if the object is exactly an instance of the specified class ; otherwise False

**3. Same class or inherit from**

Write a function that returns True if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, the specified class ; otherwise False

**4. Only sub class of**

Write a function that returns True if the object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class ; otherwise False

**5. Geometry module**

Write an empty class BaseGeometry

**6. Improve Geometry**

Write a class BaseGeometry (based on 5-base_geometry.py)

**7. Integer validator**

Write a class BaseGeometry (based on 6-base_geometry.py)

**8. Rectangle**

Write a class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py)

**9. Full rectangle**

Write a class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py). (task based on 8-rectangle.py)

**10. Square #1**

Write a class Square that inherits from Rectangle (9-rectangle.py)

**11. Square #2**

Write a class Square that inherits from Rectangle (9-rectangle.py). (task based on 10-square.py)
