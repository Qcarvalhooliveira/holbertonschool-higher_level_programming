# **Python - Almost a circle** :snake:

## **Description** :speech_balloon:

* In this project, we will review everything about Python: Import, Exceptions, Class, Private attribute, Getter/Setter, Class method, Static method, Inheritance, Unittest, Read/Write file.
We will also learn about: args and kwargs, Serialization/Deserialization and JSON.

## **What we should learn from this project:** :bookmark_tabs:

* What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
* How to serialize and deserialize a Class
* How to write and read a JSON file
* What is *args and how to use it
* What is **kwargs and how to use it
* How to handle named arguments in a function

## **Tasks** :books:

**0. If it's not tested it doesn't work**

* All your files, classes and methods must be unit tested and be PEP 8 validated.

**1. Base class**

* Write the first class Base

**2. First Rectangle**

* Write the class Rectangle that inherits from Base

**3. Validate attributes**

* Update the class Rectangle by adding validation of all setter methods and instantiation (id excluded)

**4. Area first**

* Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def area(self): that returns the area value of the Rectangle instance.

**5. Display #0**

* Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def display(self): that prints in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # - you donâ€™t need to handle x and y here.

**6. __str__**

* Update the class Rectangle by overriding the __str__ method so that it returns [Rectangle] (<id>) <x>/<y> - <width>/<height>

**7. Display #1**

* Update the class Rectangle by improving the public method def display(self): to print in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # by taking care of x and y.

**8. Update #0**

* Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def update(self, *args): that assigns an argument to each attribute

**9. Update #1**

* Update the class Rectangle by updating the public method def update(self, *args): by changing the prototype to update(self, *args, **kwargs) that assigns a key/value argument to attributes

**10. And now, the Square!**

* Write the class Square that inherits from Rectangle

**11. Square size**

* Update the class Square by adding the public getter and setter size

**12. Square update**

* Update the class Square by adding the public method def update(self, *args, **kwargs) that assigns attributes

**13. Rectangle instance to dictionary representation**

* Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def to_dictionary(self): that returns the dictionary representation of a Rectangle

**14. Square instance to dictionary representation**

* Update the class Square by adding the public method def to_dictionary(self): that returns the dictionary representation of a Square

**15. Dictionary to JSON string**

* JSON is one of the standard formats for sharing data representation.

**16. JSON string to file**

* Update the class Base by adding the class method def save_to_file(cls, list_objs): that writes the JSON string representation of list_objs to a file

**17. JSON string to dictionary**

* Update the class Base by adding the static method def from_json_string(json_string): that returns the list of the JSON string representation json_string

**18. Dictionary to Instance**

* Update the class Base by adding the class method def create(cls, **dictionary): that returns an instance with all attributes already set

**19. File to instances**

* Update the class Base by adding the class method def load_from_file(cls): that returns a list of instances
