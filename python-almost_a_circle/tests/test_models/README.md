# **Unittest - Tests Case** :snake:

## **Description** :speech_balloon:

* The unittest.TestCase class is a fundamental component of the unittest module in Python. It serves as a base class for creating test cases and provides a set of assertion methods and test execution methods.

* By creating a subclass of unittest.TestCase and defining individual test methods within it, you can organize and execute a collection of tests for your code. Each test method should focus on testing a specific aspect of your code, and assertions within the test method help verify the expected behavior.

## **Tests Models** :books:

* ### **test_base.py**
* ### **test_rectangle.py**
* ### **test_square.py**
